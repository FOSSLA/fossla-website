Open source is more than a license—it is a development model rooted in solidarity. When communities like Ladakh adopt FOSS, we gain autonomy over the tools that power education, healthcare, and governance. We can translate interfaces, audit security, and keep systems running on modest hardware.

The movement also changes how we learn. Contribution-first learning means you can start with documentation updates or testing, eventually owning sizeable features. This collaborative spirit is what turns a small community meetup into a lasting technology hub.
